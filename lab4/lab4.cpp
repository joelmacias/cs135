CS135L Week 4
Topics: Interactive Input and Library Functions

Interactive Input: cin 

+ Typically, by default the standard input is the keyboard. 
	- In C++ we can use the stream object "cin" to access it
	- "cin" will work with all primitive data types we discussed in the preveious lab
		- int, float, char, double
	- The same data type rules apply as before
		- Example: Prompting the user for a floating point number, but saving it to a variable of type int will result in loss of precision, and input 
			  failure
		- Example: Reading the character 'a' into a variable of type int will also cause input failure. 
			- Input failure stops all future reads. This will be a more of an issue once we start reading input from files 
	- Deeper into the semester you will learn how to read from files

Functions - Library Functions

+ In CS135 you will learn about two types of functions. User defined functions, and predefined functions. Predefined functions may also be called library functions.
	- Today we will review library functions 
		- A function is a collection of statements designed to perform a task. 
 These are stored in header files such as iostream.
		- Someone already wrote these functions so you dont have to!  

Links to libraries that might be useful for CS135L:

 // sample user defined function. Dont worry too much about this yet.
 void Foo(int userID, char userInitial){
 
            // Do stuff
 }
 
 
 int main(){
 
 int x = 5;
 
 // function call with arguments x and 'a', also called actual parameters
 Foo(x,'a');
 
 }

    cout << "\nEnter your first initial: " << endl;
    // will only read one character from input...but the other characters that
    // the user entered will automatically be read into the next read statement.
    char firstInitial  = cin.get();
    cin.ignore();
    
    // You don't have to use functions with assignment statements...but they may not always do
    // what you want them to do
    cout << toupper(firstInitial) << endl;
    
    // Overwriting firstInitial with its uppercased counterpart
    firstInitial = toupper(firstInitial);
    
    // This is porbably what we wanted
    cout << firstInitial << endl;
 
    // Your parameters can also be a function call
    cout << "\nEnter your last initial: ";
    cout << "\n" << toupper(cin.get()) << endl;
    
    // Those were all value returning functions. They returned a value of a specific data type
    // that you could then assign. The following is a sample void function.
    
    int q = 100;
    int w = 200;
    int x = 300;
    
    cout << "\n-Before swap function-" << endl;
    cout << "q == " << q << "\nw == " << w << endl;
    
    // This function doesn't return any value, so there is nothing you can assign to it.
    // Instead it simply performs a task
    swap(q,w);

    cout << "\n-After swap function-" << endl;
    cout << "q == " << q << "\nw == " << w << endl;

    
    
    return 0;
    

  }
