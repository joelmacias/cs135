your response.

Evaluate each of the following expressions. If the final result is
floating-point, include a decimal. Assume cmath has been included.

1. 25 % 8 - 9 / 2 => ________


2. 7 + 21 % 15 - pow(2,3) => _______


3. 9 / 4 * 6 + int(4.7) => ______


4. 4 * (2.0 / 5) - 2 => ______


5. 101 / (5 % 7) - 3 * 2.0 => _______



Suppose a program contains the following declarations and assignment
statements. Assume cmath has been included in the program.

int x, y, z;
double a, b;
x = 19;
y = 3;
a = 8.4;

Answer each of the following questions. Include a decimal if the value
stored is floating-point.

6. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = 3 + x % 6;    z is ______


7. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = int(sqrt(x+9)) + y * 2;   b is ______


8. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = y / 2 + 9.1;    b is ______



9. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = a - x % y + (x - 10) * 0.5;

   z is ______


10. What is stored in z after the statment is executed?

    z = double (y / x + 1) - a;

    z is ______
