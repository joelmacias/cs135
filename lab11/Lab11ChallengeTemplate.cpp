 Your challenge for this week is to print out a specific set of words from an input file.
 
 The words to be printed out must meet the following requriments: 
 
 1) The word precideing the word to be printed out must be a palindrome.
 2) The word to be printed out must have its first letter be uppercase, and the following letters must be lowercase
 
 In the following example, the word 'naaN' is a palindrome, thus the word 'Bread' would be printed
 
 HI i lIkE naaN Bread 
 
 
In the following example, the word 'leVel' is a palindrome, but because the word that follows 'leVel' does not meet
the requirments listed above,'THIs' would not be printed
 
 LetS leVel THIs out

 
 You may use filestreams or linux redirection to read the input file
