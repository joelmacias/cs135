/*
Lab 8 Control Structures (Repetition) - while loop and do while loop

	syntax:
		while (logical expression){
			execute statements until logical expression is false; 
		}

		do {
			execute statements until logical expression is false;
			unlike the while loop, do while will execute at least once
			regardless of the truth value of the logical expression
		} while(logical expression); 
 
 
 When to use a for loop, do while loop, or while loop
 
    for loop: Use when you know how man times this looop should execute 
 
    while loop: Use when you don't know how many times a loop will execute 
 
    do-while loop: Used when your loop should execute at least once
